Want to become a Lyft driver?  First off, take note that requirements differ from state to state. Don't worry. Let's look at the main terms you need to know.

## Basic Lyft Driver Requirements
Most drivers meet the terms to drive for Lyft. They do have a few conditions you have to meet at the least:

* Meet age and experience terms.
* Have required records (license, insurance).
* Meet car requirements (age, on approved list).
* Pass background check.

### Lyft Driver Age Requirements
Lyft requires you are at least 21 years old with 1+ year of US driving. They don't make any breaks to this rule. A great thing with Lyft is, the low age and experience required. Some ride sharing companies require greater experience. This is nice if you are in college and looking for some quick side cash.

* Must be 21+.
* 1+ year driving (within the US).

#### Lyft Driver Experience Requirements
You will need at least 1 year driving in the US. Even if you have driven for a long time in other countries, Lyft won't count that.

### Lyft Driver Required Records

The cool thing is, the records required for Lyft drivers, are pretty simple. You will have to provide these at the time you submit.

* Valid U.S. driver's license.
* Proof of car registry.
* Proof of car insurance.
* Complete driving record and criminal history screening.

#### Driver Requirements For License, Registry
New to the state? Most states require a new drivers license for folks that have moved. Do yourself a favor and don't put off the trip to the DMV! We all hate those trips. You don't want to "wreck" your chances because of an expired license. Get this done first, so you can check it off the list.

Even searching online for your local DMV can get awful. You might check DMV.org first. They are handy for getting the basics on these driver requirements. Tough it out and get it done quick! The last thing you want is to get pulled over with a rider in the back seat!

### State & Local Lyft Driver Requirements
Don't forget to meet local laws!  Lyft is great at sending you city-unique details when you apply. This helps a lot with getting over the fence to be legal in your area. Some cities have their own demands for ride sharing drivers. An list of a few of these is:

* Business license.
* Local union member.
* Local fees or taxes.
* CDL.
* Certain tags.

### Lyft Driver Background Check Requirements
Lyft driver requirements are pretty laid back compared to some. You don't need to have a perfect record to get past driver requirements. The real trick is to figure out which things in your history might create problems. Lyft is pretty clear on their terms, which does help.

* 21+ years old.
* 1+ year driving.
* No major charges past 3yrs (license taken, reckless driving).
* Max of 3 moving offense in past 3yrs (wreck, red light, stop sign).
* No serious offense past 7yrs (auto felony, hit and run).
* No DUI past 7 years.

Lyft will ask your consent for a third party background check. Lyft background checks include a 7 year history. These are some ideas of what the check looks for.

* No violent crime or sex offense.
* No theft or property damage.
* Not a felon.
* No drug offense.

Life ban on these offense types:

* Sex offense.

Lyft explains reasons they decline driver job apps. If yours gets denied, they will email you with reasons for turning you down. They do provide details on how to appeal the outcome.

### Lyft Vehicle Requirements

Lyft requires four door cars, 2005 or newer. They do require car insurance that meets state minimum. Some providers require ride-share insurance. The card needs to have your name on it.

Your car must pass an inspection and be in good shape. They will look for major types of damage or wear. Things like bad brakes, cracked glass, or other serious problems.
