## What Do Lyft Drivers Get Paid?

Lyft often claims drivers make as high as 35 dollars an hour. That sounds great but, we have to consider factors like cost as well. Lots of drivers don't mention the **cost of driving**. You might be lucky enough to hit $35 an hour, but it will take a LOT of work. Let's look at costs involved, and figure out a realistic pay range.

## What do Lyft drivers make after expenses?
A lot of independent studies show drivers making $8-12 per hour on average. Earning a bit higher, like $15-18 per hour, is possible. To achieve it, though, you'll often work 50+ hours per week in lots of cases.

It seems it takes lots of work to reach the $35 an hour level. To do it, you'll need a plan to target times and days with Prime Time pricing. It isn't easy, and will take tough work.

These are a few questions most drivers ask:

* How Does Lyft Calculate Fares?
* How Does Prime Time Pricing Affect Pay?
* Does Lyft Cover Any Expenses?

### How much are normal Lyft driver expenses?
Costs don't seem bad at first, but they grow as you drive for a living. 

* **Insurance**.
    - Most pay ~$75-150 per month for insurance.
* Car loan.
* License.
* **Tolls**.
    - Tolls grow quick. It isn't uncommon to pay over $100 per month in tolls.
* **Gas**.
    - Driving for a living, expect your fuel costs to increase 25-50% to start.
* **Car care**.
    - Oil changes, car washes, tune-ups, brakes... Budget a minimum of $1,000 per year for car maintenance.
