## Lyft Vehicle Requirements
Lyft requires a four door car that is 2005 or newer. Even if you have a sweet 2 door sports car, they won't accept it.

Lyft requires your vehicle meet state minimum insurance requirements. The policy needs to be in your name.

Lyft provides liability and collision policy of $1 million max. The deductible is $2500. This is great, as most providers won't cover ride-sharing related coverage.

* 2005 year or newer car for most cities.
* 4 doors minimum.
* In-state license plates.
* No salvage title.
* No taxi vehicle.

## Lyft Vehicle Classes
Lyft has a few classes, each with their own vehicle requirements.

* Lyft.
* Plus.
* Line.
* Premier.
* Lux.
* Lux SUV.

### Vehicles That Aren't Approved
These types of cars don't meet Lyft vehicle requirements.

* No taxis, full-size vans, government or marked cars.
* No serious mechanical or cosmetic problems.
* No salvage or rebuilt vehicles

This is a list of the unique requirements for each Lyft vehicle class.

### What about rideshare insurance?
Some providers do have policies designed for ride-sharing.

You don't need a car registered to you. If your name is on the insurance policy, that's good enough. You can drive a car that you lease.

* Car insurance in your name
* Insurance meeting state requirements
* Insurance from state you're driving

### What condition should my car be in?
You need a car without major cosmetic damage, that's clean inside and out. Your car doesn't have to be perfect condition. Ask yourself, "Would I trust this car if I was a rider?" Here's a list of items to meet Lyft vehicle requirements:

* **Engine, Suspension, Brakes**.
    - Must work and be in good condition.
* **Seat belts**.
    - Must work.
    - Must have at least 5 seat belts.
* **Lights**.
    - All lights must work.
    - Headlights, turn signals, brake lights, reverse lights.
* **Body**.
    - No body damage or large dents.
* **Tires**.
    - Tires need sufficient tread.
* **Windows**.
    - Must roll up and down.
    - No large cracks.
    - No mirror cracks.
* **Wipers**.
    - Must work and be in good condition.
* **Horn**.
    - Needs to work.
* **Seat adjustment controls**.
    - Front seats need to be able to move front / back.
* **Exhaust**.
    - Must meet state standards.
* **A/C and heat**.
    - Needs to be good working condition.


### Your vehicle must pass an inspection
![car maintenance graphic](/img/vehicle-maintenance-expenses.png)
Getting into the ridesharing game, people forget the costs involved. Auto inspections look at the major components of your car. Things like tires, brakes, lights, mirrors. The price of a full brake job or new set of tires could be $500-1K+! The costs can grow like crazy. Keep this in mind if you're in a rush to start driving. If your car has issues, get them fixed first.

Inspections consider mechanical and cosmetic car condition. You don't need a car that's perfect. If yours has big dents, faded paint, or missing body parts, you might have an issue.

## Lyft Driver Requirements
Beyond Lyft vehicle requirements, you need to meet these terms as a driver:

* 21+ years old.
* 4-door vehicle.
* Valid U.S. drivers license.
* Approved vehicle.
* Clean driving record.
* Pass background check.

[Lyft has other driver requirements](/lyft/driver-requirements/) to meet, beyond this list.
