## Lyft Vehicle Requirements
Lyft requires a four door car that is 2005 or newer. Even if you have a sweet 2 door sports car, they won't accept it.

Lyft requires your vehicle meet state minimum insurance requirements. The policy needs to be in your name.

Lyft provides liability and collision policy of $1 million max. The deductible is $2500. This is great, as most providers won't cover ride-sharing related coverage. 

### What about rideshare insurance?
Some providers do have policies designed for ride-sharing.

You don't need a car registered to you. If your name is on the insurance policy, that's good enough. You can drive a car that you lease.

### What condition should my car be in?
You need a car without major cosmetic damage, that's clean inside and out. Your car doesn't have to be perfect condition. Ask yourself, "Would I trust this car if I was a rider?"


### Your vehicle must pass an inspection
Getting into the ridesharing game, people forget the costs involved. Auto inspections look at the major components of your car. Things like tires, brakes, lights, mirrors. The price of a full brake job or new set of tires could be $500-1K+! The costs can grow like crazy. Keep this in mind if you're in a rush to start driving. If your car has issues, you might wait a bit until you can afford to fix them.

Inspections consider mechanical and cosmetic car condition. You don't need a car that's perfect. If yours has big dents, faded paint, or missing body parts, you might have an issue.
