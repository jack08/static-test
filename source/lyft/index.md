Finding the perfect job these days can be, well, difficult. This is an understatement for some on the hunt. But if flexibility and fast cash are requirements on your list, then we might have your answer: Drive with Lyft. There are a lot of incentives, here’s why:

### Drive When You Want
To drive or not to drive? It’s really up to you. If you have a slow month at work, make up for it by driving with Lyft. If you’re planning a trip next month and want some extra spending money, it’s easy to drive and boost your cash flow. There are no set hours to work — just open the Lyft app and accept rides when you’re ready. Drive on your terms.

### Receive Feedback
Once a ride is complete, passengers and drivers can rate each other, so you can learn from each ride you give. Ratings on navigation, safety, cleanliness, and friendliness are measured and sent in a weekly summary.

### Discover New Places and Friends
Want to meet new people and see new places? If you drive with Lyft, you can make friends and visit parts of the city you may not have seen otherwise. You are helping your community get around easier. Whether it be a new visitor to your city, or someone running to the grocery store to make their famous chili. With Lyft, every ride can be an adventure.

## Driver Requirements For Becoming A Lyft Driver

Most vehicles will pass Lyft's terms. You should be able to become a driver if you meet the driver and car terms. Choosing which class your car is in might seem tricky. For most cars, this won't be too tough.

* 4 doors minimum.
* In-state license plates.
* No salvage title.
* No taxi vehicle.

Read the detailed list of [Lyft vehicle requirements](/lyft/vehicle-requirements/). They seem a bit lengthy, but most are pretty simple.

## How Do Lyft Drivers Get Paid?
![lyft driver pay and expenses](/img/lyft-driver-pay-expenses.png)
Lyft pays drivers each week. If you want to become a Lyft driver, this alone is a great reason. Lyft does have a second pay option.

* Direct deposit.
* Express Pay.

Direct deposit is the normal way drivers get paid. You can choose Express Pay if you like. It will let you cash out 5 times a day! That's pretty nice.

### Boost Your Earnings
Get rewarded for going the extra mile. The Power Driver Bonus can increase your earnings by 20 percent each week for completing specific targets. Prime Time adds to your pay if you drive when there’s a ton of passengers. The extra pay from surges varies. 

Generally for the weekday commute for 9-5ers: surge times are 7:00 -10:00 AM and 5:00 – 7:00 PM. Surges occur on weekend nights from 9:00 – 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM – 3:00 AM.

### Get Paid Faster
You no longer have to count down the days until payday when you drive with Lyft. With Express Pay drivers only need $5.50 in earnings to cash out before their usual weekly deposit — receiving their cash in as little as a few hours.

### Keep All of Your Tips
Simply put: Lyft drivers get 100 percent of their tips. Plus, Lyft’s app encourages passengers to tip. Tipping is done through the app. There’s no need to ask for tips from passengers.

### Take Advantage of Lyft Rewards
Lyft offers many perks to its drivers. You can save at the gas pump at some Shell stations and even rent a car with Express Drive.

There are average hourly and weekly guarantees to help you earn a certain amount as you drive. As long as you meet certain requirements, Lyft will cover the cost of the rest of what you did not make.

Lyft has launched a new payment bonus called Streak Bonuses. As of October 2017 drivers can make extra money by accepting back-to-back rides during designated bonus hours. There is also an “Accelerate Rewards” program where drivers unlock special perks the more rides given.

The fuel rewards program with Shell is dependent on your Accelerate level (Silver, Gold, or Platinum). Saving you money on every gallon.

Lyft drivers can also shave 15% off their phone plans with Verizon.
