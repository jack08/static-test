What does it take to become an Lyft driver?  Well, first off, you'll want to be aware that the requirements will differ from state to state.  They might even be different between cities within the same state!  Don't worry, we'll cover most of the important eligibility criteria you need to know.

### Minimum Requirements to Drive For Lyft
Almost anyone can drive for Lyft, though there are a few requirements you need to meet at a minimum:

* You must be 21+ years old
* You must have a valid U.S. driver's license
* Your vehicle must be a 4-door
* Your vehicle must be on the eligibility list (more on that later)
* Driving experience requirements:
    - **Under 23 years old:** Must have 3 years driving experience
    - **23 or older:** Minimum of 1 year driving experience


### Required Documents For Lyft Applicants
Thankfully, in most cities and states, the documents required by Lyft, that you'll need to provide with your application, are pretty simple:

* Valid U.S. driver's license
* Valid proof of vehicle registration
* Valid proof of vehicle insurance
* Successfully complete online screening
    - Your driving record and criminal history will be reviewed

### State & Local Requirements to Be Aware Of
One important thing to be aware of!  These are just _Lyft's_ requirements.  There may be other **city**, **county**, or **state requirements** in your area, to become a ride-sharing driver.  In some cases, you may need to apply for or obtain certain things like this:

* Business license or permit
* Local association or union membership
* Pay local or state fees or taxes
* Insurance requirements may be greater-than required by Lyft
* In rare circumstances, a locality may require a commercial driver's license

In addition to requirements to qualify as a driver, it's important to note that your car must meet Lyft's requirements. In certain localities there may be additional requirements as well.
