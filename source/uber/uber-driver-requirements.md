What does it take to become an Uber driver? First off, you will want to be aware that requirements differ in each state. They might even differ between cities within the same state! Do not worry, we will cover most of the important eligibility criteria you need to know.

## Uber Driver Requirements
Almost anyone can drive for Uber, though there are a few requirements you need to meet at a minimum:

* You must have a valid U.S. drivers license
* Your vehicle must be a 4-door
* Your vehicle must be on the eligibility list
* Pass a background check
* Have a clean driving record

### Uber Driver Age Requirements
* You must be 21+ years old
* Driving experience requirements:
    - **Under 23 years old:** Must have 3 years driving experience
    - **23 or older:** Minimum of 1 year driving experience

### Required Documents For Uber Driver Applicants
The required documents you will also need are pretty simple, for most cities and states:

* Valid U.S. drivers license
* Proof of vehicle registration
* Proof of vehicle insurance
* Pass online screening
    - Review of driving record and criminal history

### State & Local Requirements For Uber Drivers
These are only _Uber_ requirements. There may be other **city**, **county**, or **state** ride-sharing requirements in your area. In some cases, you may need to apply for certain things like:

* Business license or permit
* Local association or union membership
* Pay local or state fees or taxes
* Insurance requirements may be greater-than required by Uber
* In rare circumstances, a locality may require a commercial drivers license

Besides driver requirements, Uber has vehicle requirements to meet as well. In certain localities there may be additional requirements as well.

### Uber Driver Background Check Requirements
Not sure if you are eligible? Here are a few details about the types of offenses the background check will look for (past 7 years):

* DUI
* Drug-related offenses
* Driving without insurance or license
* Fatal accidents
* History of wreckless driving
* Any other criminal history

The Uber background check includes searching local, state, and national levels. The actual list of items you will need for the background check is pretty simple:

#### Items Needed For Your Background Check

* Full name
* Date of birth
* Social security number
* Drivers license number

Not all offenses will disqualify you. However, any of the offense types above may make you ineligible.
