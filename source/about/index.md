UberLyfter was founded to provide helpful resources for new or aspiring ridesharing drivers. We're here to help people create their own success, and find work on _their_ own terms.

## Who is UberLyfter?
We're a small group of seasoned drivers with years of experience in the industry.  We've been through many of the difficulties you're concerned about.

## What We Aren't
Uberlyfter is an unofficial site that is not owned or operated by Uber or Lyft.  We're a group of independent people from the industry, striving to create great resources for other drivers.  The views we might express are our own and have no relation to any ride-sharing company mentioned.

## What We Provide
At UberLyfter, you'll find tutorials, resources, reviews, and data about industry trends.  The goal is to provide you the best insights into the industry, so you can make decisions confidently.

Working independently and in non-standard jobs can be a scary thing, sometimes.  It can also be a lot of fun!
